                  <p>FBB was founded in 2005 by way of a grassroots effort.  Many retired peace corp volunteers began and continue to run this program, though as the word spreads about the support they provide the composition of their board of directors includes a wider variety of backgrounds.</p>
                  <p>As an organization that provides educational and community support by way of scholarships & grants, the intentions and effects of Full Basket Belize's work is well aligned with that of Access to Opportunity.  Although the scope of AtO is not limited geographically, much of its beginnings were rooted in Belize where collaborating with FBB and networking with FBB's volunteers aided in the early growth of AtO.</p>
