                    <li><i>Members of our Network can serve as “Sponsors” who mentor, track and support Achievers.</i></li>

            <h2>Why AtO Works Inside Our Network</h2>
            <p>Working within our Network allows AtO to have unwavering confidence in the integrity, intentions, and success of Sponsors as they support Achievers.  We are not limited geographically, however our initial focus has been in the country of Belize, C.A., where we have the strongest contact networks.  For over 25 years members of our Board have traveled throughout Belize.  Making friends and building relationships through these travels has been an integral step towards developing our Network.  Through this experience we have also built a great relationship with Full Basket Belize (LINK TO FBB SECTION) which has further strengthened our awareness and connections to resources available for Achievers.</p>
